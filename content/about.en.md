## About the site

This site is named after a work of the Touhou Project, “绯想天”(*Scarlet Weather Rhapsody*), which is one of my favorites.

绯想天 is developed based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [tokiwa](https://github.com/heyeshuang/hugo-theme-tokiwa) (which is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/heyeshuang/hugo-theme-tokiwa/blob/master/LICENSE.md)). All content of the blog is distributed under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. “绯想天” is deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) being the comment system, through which you can comment with your github account.

绯想天 began as my notebook of OI learning and only contained some notes of simple algorithms and solutions, and its initial domain was feiko.me. After my gaokao, I archived the old site in [old.flandre.love](https://old.flandre.love), applied my new domain flandre.love and put some of the previous articles into it. I am working on making 绯想天 a personal blog with content of great diversity rather than simply a notebook.
